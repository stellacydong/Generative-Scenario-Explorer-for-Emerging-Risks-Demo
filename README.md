# 🌍 Generative Scenario Explorer for Emerging Risks Demo

An interactive AI-powered platform that lets reinsurers simulate novel, forward-looking risk scenarios — combining the creativity of large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of reinforcement learning (RL). Built with Streamlit.

## 🧠 What It Does

Traditional stress testing relies on historical data and limited foresight. This tool reimagines stress testing for the era of compound risks and emerging threats.

**With this app, you can:**

1. 💬 **Describe a “What if?” scenario** (e.g. hurricane + cyberattack)
2. 🧠 **Use an LLM to generate a detailed narrative + risk signals**
3. 📊 **Simulate financial losses across business lines**
4. 🤖 **Use RL to find the best reinsurance or capital mitigation strategy**
5. 📋 **Generate a management-ready summary report**

## 📂 App Structure

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🏠 Home | Problem framing and solution overview |
| 🧠 Step 1 | Generate a novel risk scenario using an LLM |
| 📊 Step 2 | Simulate losses across insurance business lines |
| 🤖 Step 3 | Use reinforcement learning to propose mitigation |
| 📋 Step 4 | View summarized report for CROs, regulators, or auditors |

## 💡 Why It Matters

Emerging risks — from climate anomalies to AI liability — can’t be modeled purely with backward-looking data. This app enables:

- **Exploration of compound and low-probability events**
- **Foresight-driven strategy** via generative AI
- **Data-grounded optimization** using RL
- **Decision support** for capital management and treaty design

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 (via Azure or OpenAI API) or Hugging Face models
- **RL Engine**: Simulated policy optimization logic
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Data Handling**: pandas, NumPy

## 📄 Example Prompt

```text
What if a 7.8 earthquake hits LA while a national cyberattack shuts down emergency infrastructure?
```

📉 The app will simulate:

* Property + cyber losses
* Business interruption
* Impact on solvency and ROE
* Recommended treaty tweaks (via RL)

---

## 📌 Use Cases

* Reinsurance pricing + product innovation
* Stress testing for capital modeling
* Risk committee simulations
* Broker-client discussions during renewals
* Regulatory scenario disclosures

---

## 🧑‍💼 Target Users

* Reinsurance risk officers
* Catastrophe modelers
* Underwriting strategists
* Brokers and rating agencies
* Regulatory reviewers

---

## ✨ Vision

This is just the beginning. The platform could evolve into a **risk imagination engine** — creating synthetic but plausible stressors for enterprise-wide risk management.

> “The future belongs to those who prepare for risks they’ve never seen.”
